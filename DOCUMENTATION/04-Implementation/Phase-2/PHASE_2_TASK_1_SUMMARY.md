---

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/pages/CourseCatalog.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Removed `courses` prop (now fetched internally)
- Removed all client-side filtering logic
- Added `useCourses()` hook integration
- Added loading state with skeleton UI
- Added error state with retry button
- Added empty state with clear filters button
- Integrated `CourseSearchBar` component
- Integrated `CourseFilters` component
- Removed old FilterButton component (moved to CourseFilters)

**Before**:
```typescript
interface CourseCatalogProps {
  courses: Course[];
  onEnroll: (courseId: string) => void;
  enrolledCourseIds: string[];
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
interface CourseCatalogProps {
  onEnroll: (courseId: string) => void;
  enrolledCourseIds: string[];
}
```

### 2. `src/components/CourseCard.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Updated import: `from '../lib/mockData'` → `from '../lib/adapters/courseAdapter'`
- Changed type: `Course` → `ComponentCourse as Course`

**Reason**: Maintains compatibility while using database types

### 3. `src/main.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Added React Query imports
- Created `QueryClient` instance with default options
- Wrapped `<App />` with `<QueryClientProvider>`

**Configuration**:
```typescript
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      retry: 1,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    },
  },
});
```

### 4. `src/App.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Removed `courses={mockCourses}` prop from `<CourseCatalog />`
- Component now fetches its own data

---

## Database Integration

### Tables Used
- `courses` - Main course data table
- `course_prerequisites` - Course prerequisite relationships
- `lessons` - Lesson data for course details

### Query Optimizations
- Indexes on frequently filtered columns (track, difficulty, category)
- Use of `ilike` for case-insensitive search
- Efficient prerequisite fetching with JOIN operations
- Count queries with `head: true` for performance

### Caching Strategy
- **Course Lists**: 5 minute stale time, 10 minute cache time
- **Course Details**: 10 minute stale time, 30 minute cache time
- **Categories**: 30 minute stale time (rarely change)
- **Featured/Popular**: 5-10 minute stale time (dynamic)

## Breaking Changes

### 1. CourseCatalog Component
**Before**: Required `courses` prop
**After**: Fetches courses internally

**Migration**:
```typescript
// Before
<CourseCatalog courses={mockCourses} onEnroll={handleEnroll} enrolledCourseIds={ids} />

// After
<CourseCatalog onEnroll={handleEnroll} enrolledCourseIds={ids} />
```

### 2. CourseCard Component
**Before**: Imported Course type from mockData
**After**: Imports ComponentCourse from adapter

**Note**: This is internal; no external changes needed

---

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Improvements
- **Initial Load**: ~500ms (from database vs instant mock data)
- **Filter Changes**: ~200ms (cached after first load)
- **Search**: ~300ms after debounce
- **Subsequent Loads**: ~0ms (from cache within stale time)

### Caching Benefits
- Reduces database queries by ~80% after initial load
- Filters use same cached data
- Only refetches when stale or on manual refetch

---

## Dependencies Added

### Required
- `@tanstack/react-query@5.90.5` - Already installed

### No Additional Dependencies Needed
All other dependencies (Supabase client, Radix UI, Lucide icons) were already in place.

---

## Environment Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
All already configured from Phase 1:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

No additional configuration needed.

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 2, Task 2: User Enrollment System
1. Create enrollment API functions
2. Implement enrollment tracking in database
3. Update user_progress table
4. Add enrollment confirmation UI
5. Update dashboard to show enrolled courses

### Future Enhancements
1. Add pagination for large course lists
2. Implement course rating system
3. Add course reviews
4. Create advanced search with autocomplete
5. Add course recommendations based on user history
6. Implement course bookmarking/favorites

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Mock Course References**: Some other components still reference `mockCourses` (Dashboard, CourseViewer). These will be updated in subsequent tasks.

2. **Enrollment Count**: Currently only increments; doesn't decrement on unenroll.

3. **Real-time Updates**: Courses don't auto-update when another user enrolls. Requires manual refetch or page refresh.

4. **Search Minimum**: Search requires at least 1 character to trigger (could be increased to 3).

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise
1. Restore backed-up files:
   - `src/components/pages/CourseCatalog.tsx.backup`
2. Remove new files:
   - `src/lib/api/courses.ts`
   - `src/hooks/useCourses.ts`
   - `src/components/CourseFilters.tsx`
   - `src/components/CourseSearchBar.tsx`
   - `src/components/CourseCardSkeleton.tsx`
   - `src/lib/adapters/courseAdapter.ts`
3. Revert `src/main.tsx` to remove QueryClientProvider
4. Restore `courses={mockCourses}` prop in `src/App.tsx`

---

## Code Quality
