### ✅ 4. CourseCard Component Updates
**File**: `src/components/CourseCard.tsx`
**Status**: COMPLETE

**New Props**:
- `isLocked` - Shows orange "Locked" badge with lock icon
- `isCompleted` - Shows green "Completed" badge with checkmark
- `onLockedClick` - Handler for locked course clicks

**Button States**:
- "Coming Soon" - Course content not yet available
- "Locked" → "View Prerequisites" - Prerequisites not met
- "Enroll Now" - Available to enroll
- "Continue Learning" - Enrolled and in progress
- "Review Course" - Completed

**Visual Indicators**:
- Lock icon for locked courses
- CheckCircle icon for completed courses
- Progress bar for enrolled courses
- Color-coded badges (orange=locked, green=completed, blue=enrolled)

### ✅ 5. CourseCatalog Page Integration
**File**: `src/components/pages/CourseCatalog.tsx`
**Status**: COMPLETE

**Changes**:
- ✅ Integrated `useAuth()` to get current user
- ✅ Added `useEnroll()` hook for enrollment mutation
- ✅ Added `useEnrolledCourseIds()` to check enrollment status
- ✅ Added `useCompletedCourses()` to track completed courses
- ✅ Added prerequisite modal state management
- ✅ Implemented `handleEnrollClick()` with:
  - Enrollment status check (prevents "already enrolled" error)
  - User authentication validation
  - Prerequisite checking
  - Modal display for locked courses
  - Enrollment mutation with error handling
  - Toast notifications for all states
  - Navigation to course on success
- ✅ Pass enrollment/completion status to CourseCard
- ✅ Handle locked course clicks (show modal)

**Key Fix (Bug #1)**:
Added check for already enrolled users before attempting re-enrollment:
```typescript
const isAlreadyEnrolled = enrolledIds.includes(courseId);
if (isAlreadyEnrolled) {
  onEnroll(courseId); // Just navigate, don't re-enroll
  return;
}
```

### ✅ 6. Dashboard Page Updates
**File**: `src/components/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
**Status**: COMPLETE

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed mock `enrolledCourses` prop dependency
- ✅ Changed from `useInProgressCourses()` to `useUserEnrollments()`
- ✅ Filter enrollments client-side to separate in-progress from completed
- ✅ Added `useCompletedCourses()` hook
- ✅ Convert database enrollments using `courseAdapter`
- ✅ Display in-progress courses in "Continue Learning" section
- ✅ Display completed courses in separate section with count
- ✅ Show real progress percentages from database
- ✅ Handle navigation to course
- ✅ Add loading states
- ✅ Empty state when no enrollments

**Key Fix (Bug #2)**:
Changed hook to show ALL enrolled courses (including newly enrolled):
```typescript
// OLD: Only showed courses with started_at != null
const { enrollments: inProgress } = useInProgressCourses(user?.id);

// NEW: Shows ALL enrollments, filters client-side
const { enrollments: allEnrollments } = useUserEnrollments(user?.id);
const inProgress = allEnrollments.filter(e => !e.completed_at);
```

### ✅ 7. App.tsx Updates
**File**: `src/App.tsx`
**Status**: COMPLETE

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed `enrolledCourseIds` state (line 26)
- ✅ Removed `setEnrolledCourseIds` state setter
- ✅ Removed enrollment logic from `handleEnroll()`
- ✅ Simplified `handleEnroll()` to just navigate to course viewer
- ✅ Removed `enrolledCourseIds` prop from CourseCatalog
- ✅ Removed `enrolledCourses` prop from Dashboard
- ✅ All enrollment state now managed by database + React Query

### ✅ 8. Database Migration
**File**: `supabase/migrations/014_enrollment_count_rpc.sql`
**Status**: DEPLOYED

**Features**:
- RPC function `increment_enrollment_count(course_id)`
- Atomic enrollment count updates
- Prevents race conditions with concurrent enrollments
- Auto-updates `updated_at` timestamp
- Proper error handling for missing courses
- Permissions for authenticated and anon users
- SECURITY DEFINER for safe execution

---

## Bug Fixes

### Bug #1: "Already Enrolled" Error When Continuing Courses
**Issue**: Users got error when clicking enrolled courses
**Root Cause**: `handleEnrollClick` always tried to re-enroll
**Fix**: Check `enrolledIds` before attempting enrollment
**File**: `src/components/pages/CourseCatalog.tsx:89-95`
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Bug #2: Enrolled Courses Not Showing in Dashboard
**Issue**: Newly enrolled courses invisible in Dashboard
**Root Cause**: `useInProgressCourses` filtered by `started_at != null`
**Fix**: Use `useUserEnrollments` and filter client-side
**File**: `src/components/pages/Dashboard.tsx:19-23`
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Testing Results

### ✅ Integration Tests (Manual)
- ✅ User can enroll in course without prerequisites
- ✅ Enrollment persists to database
- ✅ Enrollment survives page reload
- ✅ Prerequisites block enrollment correctly
- ✅ Prerequisite modal shows with correct courses
- ✅ Enrollment count increments atomically
- ✅ Dashboard shows enrolled courses immediately
- ✅ Dashboard shows completed courses separately
- ✅ "Continue Learning" works for enrolled courses
- ✅ No "already enrolled" error on continue

### ✅ User Flow Tests
- ✅ Enroll in course → Success flow works
- ✅ Enroll in locked course → Shows prerequisite modal

### ✅ Edge Cases
- ✅ Multiple users enroll concurrently → No race condition
- ✅ Enroll while already enrolled → Navigates (no error)
- ✅ Network error during enrollment → Shows error toast
- ✅ Invalid course ID → Shows error
- ✅ Not authenticated → Shows auth prompt

## Performance Metrics

### Caching Strategy
- Enrolled course IDs: 2 min stale time (frequently checked)
- User enrollments: 2 min stale time (moderate updates)
- Completed courses: 5 min stale time (rarely changes)
- Prerequisites: 5 min stale time (static data)
- Enrollment status: 2 min stale time

### Query Optimization
- `useEnrolledCourseIds` - Fetches only IDs (lightweight)
- `useUserEnrollments` - Fetches with course JOIN (complete data)
- Automatic cache invalidation on mutations
- No unnecessary refetches
- Optimistic updates reduce perceived latency

### Database Performance
- RPC function for atomic operations
- Indexed queries on user_id and course_id
- Efficient JOINs for related data
- No N+1 query problems

---

## Production Readiness

- Detailed JSDoc documentation
- React Query best practices
- Clean component structure
- Separation of concerns

### ✅ User Experience
- Optimistic UI updates
- Clear error messages
- Toast notifications
- Loading states
- Disabled states (prevent double-clicks)
- Keyboard accessibility
- Responsive design

### ✅ Reliability
- Race condition prevention
- Transaction safety
- Proper error boundaries
- Fallback UI states
- Atomic database operations
- Cache invalidation strategy

### ✅ Security
- RPC functions use SECURITY DEFINER
- User authentication checks

- No SQL injection risks
- Validated inputs

---

## Business Rules (Enforced)

✅ **User can enroll in unlimited courses**
✅ **Must complete prerequisites before enrolling**
✅ **Enrollment is permanent** (no unenroll in MVP)
✅ **Enrollment date is tracked**
✅ **Total lessons snapshot at enrollment time**
✅ **Atomic enrollment count updates**
✅ **Progress tracked separately for each enrollment**
✅ **Can continue enrolled courses without re-enrolling**
✅ **Dashboard shows all enrolled courses immediately**

---

## Known Limitations (Future Work)

1. **No Unenroll Feature**: MVP doesn't support unenrolling
   - Future: Add `is_active` column for soft delete

2. **Profile Page**: Doesn't show enrolled courses yet
   - Not required for MVP
   - Easy to add using same pattern as Dashboard

3. **Batch Enrollment**: Can't enroll in multiple courses at once
   - Future enhancement

4. **Email Notifications**: No enrollment confirmation emails
   - Future enhancement

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Test enrollment flow thoroughly
2. ✅ Verify bug fixes work
3. ✅ Monitor for any edge cases

### Phase 2, Task 3 (Next)
**Progress Tracking & Lesson Completion**
- Track lesson completions
- Update progress_percentage on lesson complete
- Update current_lesson_id
- Award XP for completions
