# User Adapter Fix - Database to UI Type Conversion

**Issue:** Profile and Dashboard pages showing blank/crashing
**Cause:** Type mismatch between database User and UI User
**Solution:** Created adapter to convert database types to UI types

---

## Problem

The Profile and Dashboard components were crashing with errors like:
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLocaleString')
```

**Root Cause:** The components were expecting mock User type fields, but receiving database User type with different field names.

## Field Name Mappings

| Database Field (Snake Case) | UI Field (Camel Case) |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| `total_xp` | `totalPoints` |
| `current_level` | `level` |
| `current_streak` | `streakDays` |
| `avatar_emoji` | `profilePicture` |
| `evm_address` | `walletAddress` |
| `hedera_account_id` | `hederaAccountId` |

## Solution

### 1. Created User Adapter (`src/lib/userAdapter.ts`)

```typescript
export function adaptDatabaseUserToUI(dbUser: DatabaseUser, walletBalance?: number): UIUser {
  return {
    id: dbUser.id,
    username: dbUser.username,
    walletAddress: dbUser.evm_address,
    hederaAccountId: dbUser.hedera_account_id || undefined,
    walletBalance: walletBalance,
    totalPoints: dbUser.total_xp,
    level: dbUser.current_level,
    streakDays: dbUser.current_streak,
    profilePicture: dbUser.avatar_emoji,
  };
}
```

### 2. Updated App.tsx

```typescript
const { user: dbUser, isAuthenticated, balance } = useAuth();

// Convert database user to UI user format
const user = useMemo(() => {
  if (!dbUser) return null;
  return adaptDatabaseUserToUI(dbUser, balance);
}, [dbUser, balance]);
```

Now `user` has the correct format for Dashboard and Profile components.

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/lib/userAdapter.ts` - Created (adapter function)
2. ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Updated (uses adapter)

## Testing

After this fix:
- [ ] Profile page loads without errors
- [ ] Dashboard page loads without errors
- [ ] User stats display correctly (XP, level, streak)
- [ ] Avatar emoji displays correctly
- [ ] Wallet balance displays correctly

## Future Improvements

**Option 1:** Update all UI components to use database User type directly
- Benefit: No adapter needed
- Drawback: Requires updating many components

**Option 2:** Keep adapter and gradually migrate components
- Benefit: Incremental migration
- Drawback: Temporary duplication

**Current Approach:** Using adapter for quick fix, can migrate later.
