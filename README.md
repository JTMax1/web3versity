## 🌍 The Problem

Africa is experiencing explosive cryptocurrency adoption (**1,200% growth in P2P trading**), yet faces a severe blockchain education crisis:

- **54 countries, 1.2 billion people** - only **8% have access** to quality Web3 education
- **Nigeria has 35 million crypto users** (more than any country globally), but **<5,000 blockchain-skilled graduates annually**
- Existing platforms cost **$200-2,000 per course** (equivalent to 2-6 months average salary)
- **78% of African employers** can't verify educational credentials
- **83% access internet via mobile only** (existing platforms are desktop-first)

**The Result:** Africa's 1.2 billion people are excluded from the **$450 billion Web3 opportunity** by 2030.
